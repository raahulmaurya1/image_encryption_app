# 🔒 Image Encryption & Decryption with Digital Signature Verification

> 🛡️ A Python-based tool to securely **encrypt**, **decrypt**, and **verify images** using a hybrid of dynamic key-based pixel shuffling and RSA digital signatures. Built for interactive use in Streamlit.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Encryption** with dynamic key-based XOR operations and pixel shuffling
- 🔓 **Decryption** to retrieve original images with high accuracy
- 🖋 **RSA Digital Signatures** to ensure image authenticity
- 🧠 **SSIM Comparison** to verify image similarity after decryption
- ⚡ **Colab Ready**: Easy file uploads, downloads, and visualization

## 📽️ Demo

> Run it directly in [Streamlit 🚀](https://imageencryptionapp-fey4sg4wuccsyzqtaf7egu.streamlit.app/)  
> No setup needed – upload an image, choose a key, and go!

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Encryption**
   - Flattens and shuffles image pixels using a pseudo-random key
   - Applies XOR operation with a dynamic key
   - Shifts image rows and columns for added security

2. **Decryption**
   - Reverses shifting and XOR operations
   - Unshuffles pixels using the same key

3. **Digital Signature**
   - Signs original image with RSA private key
   - Verifies the decrypted image hash using the public key

## 🚀 Installation

> You don’t need to install anything locally!  

However, if running locally:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cryptography scikit-image
```

## 📦 Usage

### 1. Run the Tool

```python
run_image_encryptor()
```

### 2. Choose an Option

- `1`: Encrypt and Sign an Image
- `2`: Decrypt and Verify an Image
